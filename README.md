## Hi there 👋

I’m currently a PhD Student at the Medical Image Computing department of the german cancer research center.
My work can be split in three main parts:
- 🔬 **Representational Similarity**: My primary project during my PhD was about quantifying and understanding if different models learn similar things.
- 🔧 **Methodological Deep learning**: More recently, in a more applied/methodological side of things, I am working on SSL methods and Interactive Segmentation for 3D medical image segmentation.
- 🧠 **Clinical work**: As side-project I have been working on developing deep learning models for brain metastases segmentation in MRI images with University Heidelberg medical doctors.
Aside from these I regularly participate in a variety of challenges in the MICCAI community:
- 🏆 **MICCAI 2022**: I was part of the winning team of the [AMOS2022](https://amos22.grand-challenge.org/) challenge
- 🏆 **MICCAI 2023**: I was part of the winning team of the [LNQ2023](https://lnq2023.grand-challenge.org/) challenge

Most of my research contributions can be found via my [Website](https://tawald.github.io/). I also also give talks at events and workshops. If you are interested in my work, feel free to reach out to me. I am always happy to discuss my work and collaborate on new projects.

Some more miscallenous infos about me:
- 🎤 I am an organizing member of [HeidelbergAI](heidelberg.ai),
- 💻 maintainer and contributor to the famous [nnU-Net](https://github.dev/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) framework,
